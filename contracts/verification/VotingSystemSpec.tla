  SAFETY PROPERTIES
*)

(*
  Safety: No double voting
  Each nullifier can only be used once
*)
NoDoubleVoting ==
  \A n1, n2 \in usedNullifiers: n1 = n2

(*
  Safety: Vote integrity
  Total votes never exceed number of authenticated voters
*)
VoteIntegrity ==
  LET totalVotes == \* Sum of all votes across options
    CHOOSE total \in Nat:
      total = (CHOOSE sum \in Nat:
        sum = 0 \/ \E opt \in VoteOptions: sum = votesTally[opt] + 
        (CHOOSE remaining \in Nat: 
          remaining = IF \E other \in VoteOptions \ {opt} 
                      THEN votesTally[other] 
                      ELSE 0))
  IN
  totalVotes <= Cardinality({v \in Voters: biometricAuth[v] = TRUE})

(*
  Safety: Biometric authentication required
  Only authenticated voters can cast votes
*)
BiometricRequired ==
  \A voter \in Voters:
    voterStates[voter] \in {"VoteCast", "Verified"} => biometricAuth[voter] = TRUE

(*
  Safety: System state consistency
  System must progress through states in correct order
*)
SystemStateConsistency ==
  \/ systemState = "Setup"
  \/ (systemState = "Active" /\ \E v \in Voters: voterStates[v] # "NotVoted")
  \/ (systemState = "Tallying" /\ \A v \in Voters: voterStates[v] \in {"Verified", "NotVoted"})
  \/ systemState = "Finalized"

(*
  Safety: Nullifier uniqueness
  Each voter can use each nullifier at most once
*)
NullifierUniqueness ==
  Cardinality(usedNullifiers) = Len(encryptedVotes)

----

(*
  LIVENESS PROPERTIES
*)

(*
  Liveness: Eventually, voting can start
*)
EventuallyStartVoting ==
  <>(systemState = "Active")

(*
  Liveness: If a voter is authenticated, they can eventually vote
*)

  \A voter \in Voters:
    biometricAuth[voter] = TRUE ~> 
    \E option \in VoteOptions, nullifier \in Nullifiers:
      voterStates[voter] = "VoteCast"

(*

(*
  SECURITY PROPERTIES
*)

(*
  Privacy: Vote content is encrypted
  Individual votes cannot be determined from tally
*)
VotePrivacy ==
  \A i \in 1..Len(encryptedVotes):
    \* Vote content is not directly observable
    TRUE  \* Simplified - in practice would check encryption

(*
  Anonymity: Voter identity is not linked to vote content
  Zero-knowledge proofs preserve voter anonymity
*)
VoterAnonymity ==
  Cardinality(zkProofs) <= Cardinality({v \in Voters: voterStates[v] = "Verified"})

(*
  Integrity: Vote tally matches encrypted votes
*)
TallyIntegrity ==
  LET authenticatedVoters == {v \in Voters: biometricAuth[v] = TRUE}
      totalEncryptedVotes == Len(encryptedVotes)
      totalTallyVotes ==

          \A opt \in VoteOptions: total >= votesTally[opt]
  IN
  totalEncryptedVotes <= Cardinality(authenticatedVoters)
